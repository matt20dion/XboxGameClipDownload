# XboxGameClipDownload

Users.csv file is not neccesary if you only want to download a certian users videos. I use it to download all users in my leagues videos.
If you don;t want to use it some code will need to be edited to not ask for a variable.

You can change the loop to look at any clips from any game, or other games depending on what you set.
